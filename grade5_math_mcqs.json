      "explanation": "When the dimensions of the rectangle are doubled, both the length and the width are multiplied by 2. This means the new length is 12 units and the new width is 8 units. The original area is 6 x 4 = 24 units^2. The new area is 12 x 8 = 96 units^2. Thus, the area quadruples, not just doubles.",
